# CES R environment

To use this simple R script clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/computationales/CES_R_environment.git
```

Open an R session (either in RStudio or a console) and source the script:

```r
source("install_CES_environment.R")
```

This script will install all required libraries and or github hosted packages to support local and cloud computing work. This script should be run after cluster or local updates of R (version increments) or when you install a new computer yourself.
