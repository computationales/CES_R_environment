# CES R environment

This is a simple R script to be executed in an R session using:

```r
source("install_CES_environment.R")
```

This script will install all required libraries and or github hosted packages to support local and cloud computing work. This script should be run after cluster or local updates of R (version increments) or when you install a new computer yourself.
